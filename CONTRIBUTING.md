# Contributing
Contributions are always welcome, but to keep things organized, keep in mind the following rules.

# Bug Reports
When reporting a bug in the package, make sure you follow the rules:

- You have read the Installation and General Configuration sections of the documentation;
- The issue you're facing is not documented;
- A GitHub issue with the problem you're having doesn't already exist (in an open or closed state);

Failure to do so, will result in a closed ticket.

# Pull Requests
Fixing a bug, correcting a typo or adding a new feature?

Just remember that all pull requests should be done against the `main` branch.
